# Goldbach-Numbers

### Overview

This application creates a GUI with which users interact to learn about Goldbach numbers. The user interface has two buttons - one of them computes and displays a list of multiplicities of Goldbach numbers between 4 and 2002, and the other button displays a graph of the multiplicities.  

### Bakcground

Goldbach conjecture, still remaining an open question, states that every even positive integer larger than 2 can be expressed a sum of two prime numbers. Goldbach numbers are thus even positive numbers (larger than 2) that can be expressed as a sum of two prime numbers. Multiplicities of an even number refers to the number of distinct ways to express it as a sum of two primes, up to order of addition. For instance, 2 + 2 = 4 is the only way to decompose 4 into two prime numbers. Hence, its multiplicity is 1.
