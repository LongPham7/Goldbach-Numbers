# Goldbach-Numbers

### Overview

This application creates a GUI with which users interact to learn about Goldbach numbers. The user interface has two buttons - one of them computes and displays a list of multiplicities of Goldbach numbers between 4 and 2002, and the other button displays a graph of the multiplicities.  

### Bakcground

Goldbach conjecture, still remaining an open question, states that every positive even integer larger than 2 can be expressed a sum of two prime numbers. Goldbach numbers are thus positive even integers (larger than 2) that can be expressed as a sum of two prime numbers. Multiplicity of an integer is defined as the number of distinct ways to express it as a sum of two primes, up to order of addition. For instance, 2 + 2 = 4 is the only way to decompose 4 into two prime numbers. Hence, its multiplicity is 1. The multiplicity of 8 is 1, too, since it can only be split into 3 and 5.
